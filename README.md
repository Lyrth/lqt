Overview
========

lqt is a [Lua/luajit](http://www.lua.org) binding to the [Qt5 framework](https://www.qt.io/).
It is an automated binding generated from the modified version of [Qt headers](generator/schema), and covers almost
all classes and methods from supported Qt modules.

For more info, check the documentation, [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/lqt-bindings) or contact the authors:

Features
--------

* automatically generated from modified version of Qt headers
* supported modules:
  * QtCore
  * QtNetwork
  * QtSql
  * QtPositioning
  * QtScript
  * QtQml
  * QtWebChannel
  * QtGui
  * QtWidgets
  * QtOpenGL
  * QtPrintSupport
  * QtUiTools
  * QtQuick
  * QtQuickWidgets
  * QtWebEngineCore
  * QtWebEngineWidgets
  * QtTest

* high API coverage - only a minimum of methods are not available
* C++/Qt features available:
  * method overloads
  * virtual methods (including abstract methods)
  * multiple inheritance
  * you can store additional Lua values in userdata - they act like Lua tables
  * several overloaded operators are supported
  * chosen templated classes are available, like `QList<QString>`
  * signal/slot mechanism - you can define custom slots in Lua
  * `QObject` derived objects are automatically cast to correct type thanks to Qt metaobject system
  * implicit conversion - i.e. write Lua strings where QString is expected, or numbers instead of QVariant
  * Qt `signal/slot` feature works well [test](test/test_signal.lua)
  * Also Qt `properties` are supported [test](test/test_property.lua)
* optional memory management - you can let the Lua GC destroy objects, or let Qt parent/child management do the work
* embed lua qt class system
  * `Class`  inherit from Qt C++ class [test](test/test_class.lua)
  * `isInstanceOf` check instance of a class [test](test/test_inherit.lua)
* lots of Qt offical examples lua version: [examples](examples)

History
-------

## lqt 0.9

* Public beta, most issues and API stabilized

Building lqt
------------

To compile lqt, you need:

* [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html)
* Qt `5.15.2` or above, download from [Qt offical site](https://www.qt.io/download)
    * (**WARN: Currently only Qt `5.15.2` supported!!!**)
* Compilers
    * On Windows: use `Microsoft Visual Studio 2017` or later version
    * On MacOS: use `XCode 11.0` or later version

You can get the latest source of lqt from https://github.com/lqt5/lqt .
When you have the sources.

# On Windows platform
Checkout sub module repos:
```bat
git submodule update --init --recursive --remote
```

Compile `LuaJIT`(required `msvc x64 command line environ`):
```bat
cd modules\src\LuaJIT\src
call msvcbuild.bat
```

Edit CMakeList.txt, change this line to your Qt install folder:
```cmake
    set(CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH D:/Qt/Qt5.13.0/5.13.0/msvc2017_64/lib/cmake)
```

Create an out-of-source build directory
(where the binaries will be built, I often use `build`):

```bat
md build
```

Then, use CMake to generate the msvc solution and run `cmake build`:
```bat
cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" -H. -Bbuild
cmake --build build --target ALL_BUILD --config RelWithDebinfo -j4
```

# On MacOS platform
Checkout sub module repos:
```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive --remote
```

Compile `LuaJIT`:
```sh
cd modules/src/LuaJIT
make -j8
```

Edit CMakeList.txt, change this line to your Qt install folder:
```cmake
    set(CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH ~/Qt/5.13.0/clang_64/lib/cmake/)
```

Then, use CMake to generate the Makefile and run `make` as usual:
```sh
    mkdir build; cd build
    cmake ..
    make -j4 # use parallel build with your number of cores/processors
```

Finish
------

The generated Lua binding libraries are created in the `lib` directory,
you can copy them to your `LUA_CPATH`.

Usage
-----

A quick example of "Hello World!" button with signal/slot handling:

```lua
    local QtCore = require 'qtcore'
    local QtGui = require 'qtgui'
    local QtWidgets = require 'qtwidgets'

    local app = QtWidgets.QApplication.new(select('#',...) + 1, {'lua', ...})

    local btn = QtWidgets.QPushButton.new("Hello World!")
    btn:connect('2pressed()', function(self)
        print("I'm about to close...")
        self:close()
    end)
    btn:setWindowTitle("A great example!")
    btn:resize(300,50)
    btn:show()

    app.exec()
```

For more examples, check out the `test` or `examples` folder and the `doc`
folder for documentation on detailed usage - memory management,
signal/slot handling, virtual method overloading, etc. Also, have
a look at the [examples](https://github.com/mkottman/lqt/wiki/Examples)
and feel free to add your own!
